9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
file = open(name)
word=list()

for line in file :
    line.rstrip()
    
    if not line.startswith('From '):
        continue
    else:
         words = line.split()
         word.append(words[1])          
directory=dict()

for w in word:
    if w in directory:
        directory[w]= directory[w] +1
    else:
        directory[w]=1
        
Maxnumber=0
for m in directory:
    
    if directory[m] > Maxnumber :
       Maxnumber=directory[m]
       Maxword=m
    
print( Maxword, Maxnumber)
